Introduction:

Minecast is an interpretation of role playing card games in a minetest setting.  Shamans of different colors (Red, Black, Pink, White, and Green) manifest their creature(s) (there is only one creatuer per shaman right now, but please add more !!!!)  The Shaman (you the player) mine different materials based on your color's personality.  The Shamans use these materials to create their color juju or color jujubench.    With the "juju" you can craft manifesting eggs in a 4x4 grid.  Your creature will protect you.  Right now it will attack other players.  I'm working on following.
  
The catch is that you have to log in as either:
"RedShaman"
"GreenShaman"
"BlackShaman"
"PinkShaman"
or 
"WhiteShaman"
